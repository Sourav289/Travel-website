🌴 Mangalore Travel Guide - First Web Project
Welcome to my first web development project – a simple, visually rich website showcasing the Top Places to Visit in Mangalore, Karnataka, India.
This project combines HTML and CSS to create a responsive and engaging travel page, complete with a sliding image carousel, styled sections, and detailed descriptions of must-visit destinations.

🚀 Features 
1. 🔄 Image slider showcasing popular tourist spots
2.🏖️ Detailed section on Mangalore’s culture, history, and tourism
3.🛕 Highlights of famous spots like Panambur Beach, Sultan Battery, Kudroli Temple, and more
4.📷 Hover effects on images for a modern UI feel
